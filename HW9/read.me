I chose the in-class-clusteringGenes scattering matrix plot, as I remembered the caption of the plot: It's a mess! the data is too high dimensional for a regular visualization!


Original Plot:

A pd.plotting.scatter_matrix displaying all pairwise relationships among 84 gene features.
While comprehensive, it produced thousands of small, redundant plots that were impossible to interpret.

Final Plots:

Two complementary correlation visualizations:

1-Clustered correlation heatmap with hierarchical dendrograms.

2-Masked correlation heatmap showing only the lower triangle to remove duplication.

Changes Made and Why:

1. Replaced Scatterplot Matrix with Correlation Heatmaps

Problem: The scatterplot matrix generated 3,486 subplots, each too small to show meaningful trends.

Solution: Heatmaps encode correlation strength and direction through color, allowing relationships to be seen at a glance.

Tufte Principle: Show data variation, not design variation.

2-Removed Redundancy

Problem: Each pairwise comparison appeared twice (above and below the diagonal).

Solution: The masked heatmap hides the upper triangle, eliminating duplicate information.

Tufte Principle: Avoid redundancy in communication.

3. Introduced Hierarchical Clustering

Problem: The alphabetical gene order obscured biological patterns.

Solution: Clustering groups similar genes together, revealing natural co-expression structures.

Tufte Principle: Use informative orderings and small multiples effectively.

4. Improved Data–Ink Ratio

Problem: The scatterplot matrix wasted visual space on axes, grids, and repeated frames.

Solution: Heatmaps focus visual ink on meaningful data, with a single unified color scale.

Tufte Principle: Maximize the data–ink ratio.

5. Reduced Label Clutter

Problem: Overlapping gene names made the original plot unreadable.

Solution: Simplified labels and focused on global correlation patterns rather than individual feature names.

Tufte Principle: Eliminate chart junk to clarify meaning.
