Task1: Remake a plot that we made for this class before: I used the first plot in clustering-genes done in the class. I used chatgpt to give the code, but I knew I could use heatmap to with color-bar pearson as legend. Some of  texts in the notebook, are revised by chatgpt.


Task2: Post the good and bad visualizations that you found in the literature, I posted two bad plots on slack, but I used just one of them here, the bad plot and good plot given here, show the same data. I used chatgpt to refine my texts



I tried to make two folder for the two task, but I failed! so following shows the map of these tasks
