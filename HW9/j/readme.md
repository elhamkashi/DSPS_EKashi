TASK 1:

I chose the in-class-clusteringGenes scattering matrix plot, as I remembered the caption of the plot: It's a mess! the data is too high dimensional for a regular visualization!

*** MORE DETAILED EXPLANATIONS ON THE PLOTS AND CODING ARE GIVEN IN THE NOOTEBOOK, BELOW EACH CELL****

Original Plot:

A pd.plotting.scatter_matrix displaying all pairwise relationships among 84 gene features. While comprehensive, it produced thousands of small, 
redundant plots that were impossible to interpret.
