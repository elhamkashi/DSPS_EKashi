EKashi's revised plots are much better than the original. I think she made some really good improvements. Splitting the visualization into two separate figures was really smart. It helped clutter and made the data easier to read. The clustering and dendrograms also made patterns more obvious by grouping related variables, which removed some of the confusion seen in the original plot.

In terms of distortion, the improved color scale accurately reflects the strength and direction of correlations. The diverging red-blue palette makes strong positive and negative values stand out more clearly. 

There is also less distraction in the updated plots. Removing repeated correlation values and simplifying the axis labels improves readability. The viewer can focus on the actual correlation patterns rather than trying to interpret overlapping labels and repeated information.

When comparing to Tufte’s rules, the updates definitely show improvement. The data-ink ratio increased because unnecessary ink, such as duplicated cells and heavy labeling, was removed. The design avoids chart junk, and the dendrograms add useful context rather than decoration. The use of multiple smaller visualizations also aligns with the “small multiples” concept by making comparisons easier. Redundancy was reduced significantly in the masked version, which helps the viewer interpret the information faster.

Also, the new color choices follow better visualization practices and are color-blind friendly. Overall, I believe my fellow classmate's desicions were appropriate and improved the plot by a considerable amount.


2. Other comments (bad plot, etc.):

I took a look at EKashi's selection for the "bad" plot and I would say I have to agree. Although it was pretty obvious by just a glance, her explanation as to why she believed her selection wasn't too good further convinced me. The plot she chose violates essentially all of Tufte's rules. It is apparent there was no effort to reduce confusion on the author's part. I agree with her suggestion that it would be best to split this plot into two and possibly integrate a more friendly color palette.
