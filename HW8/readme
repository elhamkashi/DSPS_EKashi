by the end of task7, mostly I did the tasks myself, correction with Gemini, and some explaiantions by chatgpt, especially to refine the captions, 
other places done by chatgpt is mentioned in the notebook.

Task 8a, helped by chatgpt but not mainly!

Task 8b, the first code was given by chatgpt then I tried to change it but I failed to return the nice results by the first code!
