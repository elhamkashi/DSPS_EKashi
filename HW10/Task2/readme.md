I completed this homework with the assistance of ChatGPT, using it as a guide to understand each step of the neural network workflow. With its help, I visualized the MNIST images, prepared and reshaped the data correctly, and built  a convolutional neural network (CNN). ChatGPT clarified the purpose of each code block, explained the meaning of training and validation loss curves, and helped me compare the performance of the two models using their accuracy and loss values. It also supported me in creating captions, explanations, and a final comparison paragraph. This guidance helped me understand not only how to implement the models but also why the CNN performs better for image classification tasks.
