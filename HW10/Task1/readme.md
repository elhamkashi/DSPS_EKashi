In completing this DeepDream homework assignment, I independently ran all the code, selected the network layers, generated the visualizations, and explored the effects of different parameters in my own Colab notebook. I used ChatGPT only as a learning aid to help me better understand the behavior of different Inception layers, clarify concepts related to convolutional neural networks, and improve the clarity of my written explanations. All computational work, images, experiments, and interpretations originated from my own notebook; ChatGPT’s role was limited to providing conceptual guidance and helping me express my observations more clearly in caption form.
