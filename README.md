I decided to take Data Science for Physics because I realized that I need stronger skills in coding, data analysis, and interpreting figures and diagrams in scientific papers. While my main background has been in theoretical quantum optics, I found that when I tried to work with coding and read data-driven papers, I often struggled. After taking a quantum algorithms course, I also understood that learning data science fundamentals is essential before diving deeper into areas like machine learning or quantum computing. This course is not strictly mandatory for my research, but I personally felt it was a necessary step for me.
What I hope to learn the most is how to code more confidently, how to analyze and visualize data in a meaningful way, and how to apply machine learning concepts in physics. I want to become comfortable with both the computational side and the interpretation side of modern physics research.
The main strength I bring to the class is my background in theoretical physics, which has trained me to think carefully about models, assumptions, and mathematical structures. Even if I am new to coding and data analysis, I am persistent, curious, and willing to work hard to connect these new skills with research field.
