# Data Science for Physical Scientists - Learning Journey

 Background and Motivation:

I decided to take **Data Science for Physics** because I realized I need stronger skills in:

- **Coding and programming**
- **Data analysis techniques** 
- **Interpreting figures and diagrams** in scientific papers

While my main background has been in **theoretical quantum optics**, I found that when I tried to work with coding and read data-driven papers, I often struggled. After taking a quantum algorithms course, I also understood that learning data science fundamentals is essential before diving deeper into areas like machine learning or quantum computing.

## Course Context

This course is not strictly mandatory for my research, but I personally felt it was a **necessary step** for my professional development and skill building.

## Learning Objectives

What I hope to learn the most:

### Primary Goals:
- How to **code more confidently**
- How to **analyze and visualize data** in a meaningful way
- How to **apply machine learning concepts** in physics contexts

### Broader Aspirations:
- Become comfortable with both the **computational side** and **interpretation side** of modern physics research
- Bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical data analysis
- Develop skills that will support future work in quantum computing and machine learning

## Strengths and Approach

### Background Strengths:
- **Theoretical physics background** - trained to think carefully about:
  - Mathematical models and structures
  - Underlying assumptions
  - Theoretical frameworks

### Personal Qualities:
- **Persistent** and **curious** learner
- **Willing to work hard** to connect new skills with research field
- Open to building computational skills from the ground up

## Connection to Research

This learning path represents my commitment to developing the **comprehensive skill set** needed for modern physics research, combining theoretical rigor with practical data science capabilities.
